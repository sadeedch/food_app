  <h2 class="bg-success" style = "width: 450px;" > Peer Review Reflection</h2>
    <p> This was the first time I have done peer reviews in any of my courses. To me, doing the peer review has both pros and cons. 
    The benefits of the peer review are students get to identify the strengths and weaknesses of their code and they get to know how the other student has tackled a certain problem.
    They can share the idea of how to solve a certain problem. This also provides the students to bounce their ideas to each other. 
    As one student cannot have the same reviewer for two consecutive weeks, this provides the student to get to know more students. 
    Students also receive the feedback to their code. 
    But at the same time, there are few disadvantages to this approach as well.
    One of the main disadvantage is that both the reviewers are students and they have the soft corner for each other.
    This results in unwilling to critically think about other students work and often default to unwilling praise. 
    If both do not know about a certain solution, they are unable to provide a helpful feedback to each other. 
    So I think this approach is a waste of time too. </p>
